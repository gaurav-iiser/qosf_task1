# qosf_task1

This contains the .ipynb file to exceute the task 1 of qosf mentorship program.
### To execute the code:
1. Run the given two blocks of codes.
2. Then define a variable of type Task_1 and initialize it with the list of integers (of any length) as follows:<br>
    For eg: c = Task_1([1,5,7,10])
3. The output will contain:<br>
    a. A histogram indicating the states of superpostion and their coefficient in the superposed state.<br>
    b. The state vector of the final quantum state.

#### The code works for any kind of list of integers, even for lists with repeated entries.
